# Salmon Count Labels
Must be used with CVAT's dataset repository advanced options when creating a task.

New temporary branches made by CVAT will be automatically merged by GitHub workflows.

All of these annotations are in the "[CVAT for Videos 1.1](https://opencv.github.io/cvat/docs/manual/advanced/xml_format/)" format and can be used with [Datumaro](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/datumaro) to split into train/validation/test sets and convert them to other formats.
