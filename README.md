# Salmon Count Labels
Tracking box annotations of salmon swimming upstream in a river. Most of the annotations are from the Kitwanga river with some from Bear Creek. The video data may be made public in the future.

Must be used with CVAT's dataset repository advanced options when creating a task.

New temporary branches made by CVAT will be automatically merged by GitHub workflows.

All of these annotations are in the "[CVAT for Videos 1.1](https://opencv.github.io/cvat/docs/manual/advanced/xml_format/)" format and can be used with [Datumaro](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/datumaro) to split into train/validation/test sets and convert them to other formats.
